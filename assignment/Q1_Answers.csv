Q1. 3) One of the findings that really surprised me was the number of jobs; I did not expect these numbers to be this high for each occupation, but I guess it makes sense when thinking about the total population of the United States. Another thing that surprised me was a 17% growth outlook for financial managers; I would not have guessed that this occupation was growing this much.
4) Data Scientists, Financial Managers, Industrial Engineers, Sales Managers, Architects, Bakers, Health Education Specialists, Rehabilitation Counselors, Childcare Workers. I ranked these jobs in this order due to my personal opinion in wanting to work this specific occupation. Near the end of the list, however, I more based it on salary and amount of work that I believed the job required.
